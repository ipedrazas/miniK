# miniK - A polyglot programming language


TL;DR: You do **not** have to learn this language, but your children might.

My experiences teaching children to program have been a sweet and sour pill harder to swallow than expected. Children start with [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu)  and they love how quickly they can produce (noisy) programs (using loud colours) that do different things. From a game (always a winner) to a book or even a video.

Then you try to get serious and you can take the HTML road or the Python street. And they are good, very good, but there's something that I've noticed: programming language are based on English and guess what? not only English speaking children want to learn to program!

Why do I have to learn English to write python? why do I have to use the English keywords instead of Spanish or French or Dutch? The CEO of codeclub told me once that children that want to learn to program must learn those keywords first.

Think about it. A simple "Do while" loop makes sense in English but it means absolutely nothing to a Peruvian child. Yes, that child can learn that in order to do a loop, that's the label you have to use, but again, those keywords have no real meaning.

It seems that non-speaking English children (and no children too) have to learn the ins and outs of a programming language, and English.

`miniK` is a language where keywords are in your own language, so for example, our classic "Hello World!" would be in english

    print "Hello World"

But in Spanish it would be

    imprimir "Hola Mundo!"

Or French

    imprimer "Bonjour le Monde!"

Or Dutch

    afdruk "Hallo Wereld!"

As you can guess, miniK is not about performance nor anything fancy you would ask to a proper language. It's just a tool to help to jump into programming without the language barrier.
